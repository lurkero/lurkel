After all, is there a better way to celebrate Valentine's Day than by celebrating some of the best things ever said about love?.</p>

An individual in the brigade may not be able to see the end result, i.e., the water being thrown on the fire to put it out, but the contribution of the individual is indispensable to the final outcome.”</p>
