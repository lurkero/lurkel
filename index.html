				<p>Celebrating your small wins will help you stay motivated through your journey. Plus, celebrating is always super fun</p>

If you are one of those, think of a fire brigade, a line of people passing buckets of water from one to the other from a source of water to the site of the fire. An individual in the brigade may not be able to see the end result, i.e., the water being thrown on the fire to put it out, but the contribution of the individual is indispensable to the final outcome.”</p>
